# Surfs_Up Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to perform weather pattern analysis in Hawaii for the month of June and Decemeber to help assess wheatherr an ice cream/surf shop would be a good weather condition to operate.
  

## Results
These two tables tell us about the differing weather patterns for the two monthly periods. 

<table>
 <tr>   
   <td align="center"> <b> June Temperature is Hawaii </b> </td>
   <td align="center"> <b> December Temperature is Hawaii </b> </td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>  
    <td valign="top"> <img src="/Resources/June_statistics.png" width="250" /> </td>
    <td valign="top"> <img src="/Resources/Dec_statistics.png" width="250" /> </td>
  </tr>     
</Table> 


## Some takeaways from the above results
1.  Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively, show a moderate temperature and very little fluctuation between the two periods from an average standpoint.
2.  The maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also remarkable similar.
3.  The minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) show the greatest variance, and reflects a much lower temperature level in December that may not be conducive to ice cream or surfing. However, with standard deviations of 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December) we would expect a little more variation in the december numbers.
