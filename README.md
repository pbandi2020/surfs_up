# Surfs_Up Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to perform weather pattern analysis in Hawaii for the month of June and Decemeber to help assess wheather an ice cream/surf shop would be a good weather condition to operate.
  

## Results
### The below shows the statistical comparison between the month of June & December 

<table>
 <tr>   
   <td align="center"> <b> June Temperature is Hawaii </b> </td>

  </tr>     
</Table> 


### Some takeaways from the above results
1.  Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively, show a moderate temperature and very little fluctuation between the two periods from an average standpoint.
2.  The maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also remarkable similar.
3.  The minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) show the greatest variance, and reflects a much lower temperature level in December that may not be conducive to ice cream or surfing. However, with standard deviations of 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December) we would expect a little more variation in the december numbers.


## Summary

Oevrall the temperature statistics in December and June are very similar. I suggest we need additonal analysis to make a right decision and come to a conclusion on weather data analysis. Comparison of weather by station as we may have higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations is needed to complete the analysis. There needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not so much that you lose out on that ideal surfing and ice cream weather. Addiitonal queries on precipetation is what we need next.
1.  Historical precipitation data is needed.
2.  How active the stations are / which station tends to have the most precipitation recording is also another needed metric.
3.  Along with the above two, temperature comparison by station and across multiple months togeher would provide a more deeper look at data.
